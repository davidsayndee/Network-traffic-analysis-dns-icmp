# Network Traffic Analysis – DNS & ICMP Incident Response

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a real-world network troubleshooting scenario in which users were unable to access a website due to DNS resolution failure. As a cybersecurity analyst, I performed packet analysis using tcpdump and analyzed ICMP responses.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- tcpdump
- ICMP/DNS Protocol Analysis
- Linux Terminal

## 🚨 Summary
Clients couldn’t access `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` due to a DNS error. The analysis revealed port 53 was unreachable, and ICMP error messages confirmed the DNS server was not responding.

## 💡 Key Learnings
- DNS troubleshooting using packet analyzers
- ICMP error interpretation
- Incident report writing
